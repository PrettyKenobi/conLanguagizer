For Contributors
=================

Thank you for wanting to help! Our :doc:`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst` gives the ground rules for interacting with each other. In brief, be respectful and kind.

Community Building
------------------

Right now, PrettyKenobi is the only leader, which is a lot of work for one person to do. So we need folks to help manage things when it comes to coding and growing and/or moderating the community. Those interested in a leadership role in one or more of these areas should get in contact with Ken via email_.
