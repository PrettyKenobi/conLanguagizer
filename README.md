# conLanguagizer

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

A digital binder for you constructed language. Keep track of your conlang's phonology, orthography, and word definitions with a dictionary. Organize the rules of your language in the grammar. You can define them using the [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) method or the more human readable cLa syntax. conLanguagizer can then apply the grammar to one or more words in the dictionary so you don't have to conjugate yourself!
